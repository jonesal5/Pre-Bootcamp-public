I opened my terminal
created a new directory, called it ‘test’
made files called index.html, style.css, commands.txt
made copy of index.html, called it index_2.html
made another directory called destination
moved index_2.html to the destination directory
removed style.css
deleted destination directory


there are no contents to display in the terminal for file ‘commands.txt’ is empty- however, here are a few commands.


1. pwd-Present working directory
2. ls-list files
3. ls-l- list files(long form)
4. cd-changing to the parent directory
5. cd .- changing to the current directory
6. cd /- changing to the root directory
7. cd folder_name-changing to any folder
8. mkdir new_directory_name- making a new folder
9. touch index.html-creating a new file
10. touch style.css- creating a new file
11. open .- opening current directory in your GUI
12. cp -copyrf directory_name copy_directory_name- copying a directory
